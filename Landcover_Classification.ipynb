    "# 2D Landcover Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### About The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was completed as a senior capstone project by Blake Marshall, Sean Farmer, Jacob Sellers, & Isauro Ramos at Sonoma State University in fall 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Larger Initiative: BioSCape\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of the larger **BioSCape** initiative, a collaboration aimed at understanding biodiversity in the Greater Cape Floristic Region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Biodiversity Survey of the Cape** is a NASA-SANSA Biodiversity research project focused on the Greater Cape Floristic Region of South Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This initiative utilizes hyperspectral images captured by the AVIRIS-NG remote sensor to analyze and classify land cover types. These hyperspectral images, containing 432 bands, provide detailed spectral data that enable precise classification across diverse ecological categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about [BioSCape](https://www.bioscape.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Land Cover Classification Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wetlands**\n",
    "- **Planted Forest**\n",
    "- **Permanent Crops** (e.g., vineyard)\n",
    "- **Unconsolidated Barren**\n",
    "- **Natural Grassland**\n",
    "- **Consolidated Barren** (e.g., rocks, salt pans)\n",
    "- **Built-up Areas**\n",
    "- **Mixed or Not Classified**\n",
    "- **Natural Wooded Land**\n",
    "- **Waterbodies**\n",
    "- **Annual Crops** (e.g., wheat)\n",
    "- **Shrubs**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hyperspectral Land Cover Mapping**  \n",
    "   Leveraged hyperspectral imaging from the remote sensor AVIRIS-NG to classify the terrain into the categories listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **2D Classification Approach**  \n",
    "   Explored a two-dimensional (2D) methodology for land cover classification."
